Mobile Audio Sampler and Music Production Application

Three tabs: PLAY, RECORD, and LIBRARY

---PLAY---
Press a button and hear its assigned sound.
The top three rows are for samples, their sounds are interrupted when another sample button is triggered.
The lowest four buttons are for drum sounds, their sounds go uninterrupted despite any additional pads being pressed.

---RECORD---
Press "record" and begin recording a sample immediately.
Press "pause" to momentarily halt recording, and again to resume recording.
Press "stop" to stop recording and allow playback.
Press "play" to hear the new recording.
Press "save" to store the recording as a new sample in the library.
(Recordings are named via date/time)

---LIBRARY---
Choose from previous recordings and a few preloaded sounds to start.
Select a cell to be able to play it back, as well as assign it to a numbered pad on the PLAY screen.
If there is already a sound assigned to your chosen pad, you will be asked for permission to overwrite. 

Record your own drum sounds, record people playing instruments, record anything you want. Then just assign the sounds to pads and make your own music out of it.
